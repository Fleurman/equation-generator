# Equation Generator

A simple two operators equation generator written in lua.
This module output an equation containing 4 numbers as a string.

I made this module for this little game: [Logic Training With Brain](https://gweebit-prod.itch.io/logic-training-with-brain)

My TODO list:
- add comments
- add some parameters inputs


## How-To

Simply add the module and call the function "newEquation()" to return an equation as a string.
